# Overview
This Repository is a commprehensive guide on how to "hack"/mod your Nintendo 3DS. With this guide you will be installing Custom Firmware (CFW), meaning a full software modification to your Nintendo, comparable to an "administrator access" on a computer. It allows you to do anything that the 3DS is physically capable of doing, rather than being limited by whatever Nintendo allows you to do. Now what does this guide **exactly** install?
This guide will:

- Install boot9strap and Luma3DS custom firmware on unmodified retail 3DS/2DS consoles
    - Luma3DS will automatically remove the region lock and allow you to run unsigned software
- Install various pieces of homebrew software, such as a package installer, save file manager, and a homebrew app store
- Make critical system file backups that can help avoid bricks (and recover data in the event of one)

>[!WARNING]
>By modding your console, you subject it to the remote (but non-zero) possibility of the console being bricked (rendered non-functional). Incorrect file placement will NOT brick your console, but purposely skipping instructions might.

In short: Modding your console is safe, but it's your responsibility if something goes wrong.
